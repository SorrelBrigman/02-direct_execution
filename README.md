Class exercise in using shebang to execute a hello world in the terminal without the "node" command


Link to class assignment requirements here: https://github.com/nashville-software-school/node-milestones/blob/master/01-foundations/exercises/02-direct_execution.md

in addition to the shebang in the js file, there was also use of the chmod in the command line in order to be able to use the execute permissions on the js file.

I had to use `chmod +x direct-exec.js` in order to have permission to execute the file.

additionally, the file was executed with the terminal command:
`./direct-exec.js`
